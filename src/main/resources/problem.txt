Code Challenge "Robot Commands"
Develop a simple environment for a robot where you could control it using this predefined script:
POSITION 1 3 EAST //sets the initial position for the robot
FORWARD 3 //lets the robot do 3 steps forward
WAIT //lets the robot do nothing
TURNAROUND //lets the robot turn around
FORWARD 1 //lets the robot do 1 step forward
RIGHT //lets the robot turn right
FORWARD 2 //lets the robot do 2 steps forward
This script should be sent from frontend to backend as a single chunk using POST Method. After script execution, UI should render a new robot position on the grid and direction it looks to.
Please implement a movement/business logic using Java+Spring in backend. Frontend should be only responsible for submitting the script and rendering robot on the grid.
For aesthetic reasons, you should limit the grid in the Frontend for the robot to 5 x 5 steps. The initial grid position is 0,0 and is in the top left corner.
It is optional, if the backend will be also aware of the grid limits.
Frontend should be styled. You could do it yourself or use some framework.
Please create tests as much as you think is necessary.
You can spend as much time on this task as you like, however, we don't expect you to invest more than 4 to 6 hours on this task. If you are not able to finish everything in the given time-frame, please add a readme.md file that describes, what you'd tell us about your current status in a daily stand-up meeting. We'd love to know what parts you consider finished, what your next steps would be and which of the things you wrote already you'd still like to improve if there was more time. Please send a link to your solution on GitHub.
